     <tbody>
    <tr>
     <th>Unplug Items Youâ€™re Not Using</th>
     <td>Excess electricity flowing through your home's things is always a possible fire threat. Computers, televisions, game systems, and other electronic devices utilize power even when they are turned off. That implies they can always encounter a spike or simply overheat and catch fire.</td>
   </tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
    <tr>
     <th>Never Leave Flames Unattended</th>
     <td>If you're cooking, lighting candles, or using any other type of flame or high heat, you should keep an eye on it at all times. When you start cooking something, you never want to leave the stove. If you start a fire in your fireplace, you should keep an eye on it as well.</td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
     <th>Donâ€™t Smoke Indoors</th>
     <td>If you do smoke, it is critical that you do so in a well-ventilated area and that you completely extinguish the cigarette before discarding it. Cigarettes contain a variety of additives and materials that can continue to burn even after you think you've extinguished them.</td>
     <tr>
     <th>Cut The Clutter</th>
     <td>Clutter in your home is one of the ways that fires can not only start spontaneously, but also spread rapidly. By keeping less clutter in your home, you can reduce your risk and increase your chances of saving your home in the event of a fire.</td>
   </tr>

<tbody>
   <tr>
     <th>Remove Lint And Change Filters</th>
     <td>Your heating system requires a filter to function, but how often do you replace it? You should do it on a regular basis because if lint builds up in the filter, the heat from the furnace can ignite it.</td>
   </tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
   <tr>
     <th>Keep Oils And Gases Away From Flames And Sparks</th>
     <td>Flammable materials such as fabrics, paper, and even hair should be kept away from extreme heat or flame. When you're starting a fire in your fireplace, you want to keep your hair and clothes out of the way.</td>
   </tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
   <tr>
     <th>Get The Furnace Checked</th>
     <td>No matter what you do to protect your home, there are some things that you simply cannot do on your own. Having your furnace inspected on a regular basis and scheduling regular maintenance is always a good idea.</td>
   </tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
   <tr>
     <th>Use Surge Protectors</th>
     <td>At the very least, make sure that all of your electronics are connected to surge protectors. When there is a surge in power, you are more likely to have an electrical fire, and by plugging items into a surge protector, you don't have to worry about that excess electricity getting to the item and causing a fire.</td>

<tbody>
     <tr>
     <th>Check The Electrical Frequently</th>
     <td>That doesn't mean you should dig into your home's walls to check electrical wires, but you should check everything that's visible. Keep an eye on your home's wall outlets and pay attention to any that suddenly stop working.</td>
